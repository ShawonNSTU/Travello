                                                     My Final Year Project

1) A login page will appear initially and the user has to login in order to continue.
2) If the user is new, then he/she will have to fill the registration form (username, password, email etc.)
3) These details will be submitted to an online database.
4) After logging in, the user will get a screen called Home Page.
5) In the Home Page there will be several posts by the user’s friends.
6) These posts must contain a review of a place that he/she visited recently.
7) These posts also can have some description and captured image of that place.
8) The image must be of a place. There is no allowed to post user’s own picture as the post contains the description of the place and rating. The user can upload own image as profile picture. This app will use Image Processing to detect whether the post contains a place image or human picture. This also help to detect adult content and omit it.
9) User’s friend can react with these posts through like/comment/share with Facebook.
10) Every user must have a Profile including his/her information and uploaded pictures. 
11) On the side navigation bar of Home Page there will have 2 types of Search option.
12) One for searching to know about a place. By means of knowing about route, cost and to stay. From the information of user’s review, this app will be run based on an algorithm to set the ultimate review of a place.
13) One for knowing about the user review of a specific place that was posted previously by any user.
14) One interesting feature is that by this app user can see the nearby restaurant, coffee shop and hotel which will help them when they will travel a new place..
15) Also user can see his/her nearby tourist place. [Optional]
16) Another interesting feature is that user’s review/post can be read by Text Recognition. That means user can hear the post. This will be helpful for the blind people who want to know about the place. Again by the Speech Recognition it can convert the user’s speech to text and finally able to post.
17)  User can plan a trip and can find new people of his/her area who are planned to trip those location.
